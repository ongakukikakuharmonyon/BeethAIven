# ðŸŽ¼ BeethAIven - AI Beethoven-style Composer

An AI composer that generates original piano pieces in the style of Beethoven. This project uses music21 for style analysis and a rule-based or probabilistic model for composition.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To develop an application that allows users to select a length (16-144 bars) and instantly generate, play, view, and save a structurally coherent piano solo piece in the style of middle-period Beethoven.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language/Analysis:** Python, music21
- **UI:** Streamlit
- **Score Rendering:** MIDI, MusicXML, LilyPond (or external services)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
